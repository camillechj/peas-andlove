## Creating a .qug file
1. Open the excel file 00_qugTemplate2.xlsx
1. Edit the sheet using information gathered from the literature 
    * For map, locus effects, and marker effects:
        * The map contains all markers and QTLs
        * The locus effects only contains QTLs
        * The marker effects only contains markers 
1. Save each sheet individually as a .csv file 
    * Make sure to delete content in unneeded cells (hold ctrl+shift+rightarrow/downarrow) and right click to delete
1. Open the copy_paste file
1. Open R and change the working directory 
1. Make sure csv file names match up with the ones in the copy_paste file 
1. Run the code from the copy_past file in R. This should generate a .qug file 

## Creating a .qmp file
1. Download the template .qmp file 
1. Fill out information about the breeding strategy (e.g. initial population size, number of cycles, number of runs, selection methods, etc.)
